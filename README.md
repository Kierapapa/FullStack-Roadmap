### OS and General Knowledge < DO THIS!
- OStep, skim this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iPD0JzZ5OSvIS03e_PkymYf4ySEeGjQX/view?usp=sharing (you are on chapter 11)
    - How do OSes work? Virtualization, Concurrency and Persistence  :heavy_check_mark:
    - Process Management
      - Process API: Create, Destroy, Stop, Start, Wait, Status.
      - Create: Modern OSes lazy load the important bits of an EXECUTABLE program from an SSD into memory
      - Memory Allocation in the form of a heap(user allocated, ex: malloc) and a stack(stores argc and argv array on initialization). 
        - requires Paging and Swapping.
      - Each process has 3 file descriptors STDERR, STDIN, STDOUT
      - Process states: 
        - running
        - blocked 
        - ready
        ![process states](ps.png)
      - Some OS APIs
        - fork() - creates a parallel process of the program which it was called from
        - wait() - let's the parent wait for the child process to finish(also provides determinism)
        - exec() - runs a different program using the same process
    - Threads and Concurrency
      
    - Memory Management
      - Heap
        - malloc() stores in heap, free() releases it
        - How can i not call free() when I run a short-lived program?
          - Well, the OS gives you two abstract layers of the memory, some for the process AND some within each process. So for shorter-lived programs not calling free is okay because the OS frees the process and the heap was created in the second level of abstraction, the per process memory. 
      - Segmentation 
        - Storing Code, Stack and Heap in ways that allow minimal space wastage
        - Paging 
          - Storing data in pages
        - Swap space
          - Location of virtual memory save to swap pages 
      - Page fault
        - When a page is not available in virtual memeory it looks send a page fault or a page not available and fetches the page from the physical memory
      - Pages are replaces as required using a page replacement policy
      - Workloads of policies and their performance
        - No locality
        - 80-20 workload
        - looping workload
      - TLB
        - provides the system with a small hardware cache of address translations
      - Address translations
        - Converts memory addresses to physical addresses
    - Interprocess Communication
    
    - I/O Management
    
    - POSIX? 
      - standards that ensure compatibility when moving between OSes
      - stdin, stdout, stderr and pipes: https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/
      - Unix v. Linux, neither are OSes: 
      - Unix: Solaris, BSD, MacOS
        - an entire OS
      - Linux: Ubuntu, fedora, debian, android
        - just a kernel that is "distro"'d.
    - Terminal commands: 
      - grep
      - awk
      - sed
      - lsof
      - curl
      - wget
      - tail
      - head
      - less
      - find
      - ssh 
      - kill

### Learn a language
- Okay i just got the shaft in an interview for not knowing js well enought. Qs?: What are promises, Event loop, What really is node.js.
- I'll post links from the bookmarks


### Relational databases
MySQL: https://www.udemy.com/course/mysql-and-sql-from-beginner-to-advanced/learn/lecture/5050050#overview
- The freecodecamp course is good for postgres. 
- Need to answer questions like what are relational databases and why use them.(ACID) 
- Did you know mongo was eventually consistent
- 


# FrontEnd

### Internet :heavy_check_mark:


### HTML
Semantic HTML 
- https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271 *TODO*
Forms and validation:
- not sure what i don't know here
Conventions and best practices: 
- same^

- ?
SEO Basics:

### CSS
Responsive design and media queries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgOO9YUFlGI&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABDU532eesybur5HPBVfC1G&index=9&loop=0  *review*
FEM 1:
  - Responsive Design:
    - Flexible Grid Based Layout
    - Media-Queries
    - Images that resize
  - Floats
    - Hack for layout
    - "The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container."
  - box-sizing: border-box (uses the border box model that includes the width of the content, border and margin all in to the box.
    - make everything inherit it:
    *, 
    *:before, 
    *:after {
     box-sizing: inherit;
    }
  - col-md-4?
    - bootstrap syntax
    - md: width of page is  >= 768 px
    - 4: spans 4 of the twelve columns in the page

### JS
Fetch api
- Axios

### Version Control :heavy_check_mark:

### Web security
- Not done much besides owasp, cors and https, do more of the latter two(check out the guide from the backend section)

### CSS Architecture
- BEM
  - v good: https://youtu.be/er1JEDuPbZQ

### CSS Preprocessor
- Sass
  -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI :heavy_check_mark:
  - Don't try and use it. CSS in is is so much more intuitive.

### Build Tools
#### Task Runners
Npm scripts :heavy_check_mark:

#### Module bundlers
Parcel baby!

#### Linters and formatters
- Prettier plugin
- eslint files or jetbrains plugin

### Pick a Framework : React
FEM React https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v5/
  - useEffect hook , need to declare dependencies or it will 'useEffect' every time render is called.
  - dropdowns are great for custom hooks
  - useEffect replaces the lifecycle methods
  - general js, but if you get a map back that looks like :
    ![destructure](destructure.png)

  
  you can get just the names from it by using destructuring:
  const breedStrings = breeds.map(({name}) => name)
  
  - One-way data flow: children never cause parents problems, just like real life, amiright?
  - Arrow functions and this in component lifecycle.
  - static getDerivedStateFromProps, takes in a set of props and gives you a new set of state. 
  - Need an event listener? use arrow functions and you won't need a bind
  - Modals are what popups that ask are you sure are called.
    - Trap focus of a modal: https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-create-an-accessible-react-modal/
    - Oh, and i've got a pretty great modal that i've starred.
  - **grail** All of the advanced topics(16+) here are siloed so you can just use what you need(redux, TS, testing): https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v5/
    - If you want to learn anything, download the parent repo from the master branch and each section uses that as a fresh start.
   - Redux saga is for async use of redux
   - **grail** super useful break up of what react is and what it's not(as opposed to angular).: https://amp.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/clghfx/angular_vs_react_which_would_you_choose_in_2019/


#### State management
- need to do the FEM Redux course
- Context :heavy_check_mark:

### Modern CSS
- find a class on emotion

    - Lookup refresh tokens and all that, extending token length https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26739167/jwt-json-web-token-automatic-prolongation-of-     expiration?rq=1
  - **Holy Grail** Distributed/ Load balanced servers and need to keep servicing Request with JWT(in English, if you have multiple servers, the server keeping track of the auth might not be the same server that has low load and will serve a future request. so you just share have a **shared secret**. The private key for the jwt). This apparently is called symmetric encryption.

- CORS: 2nd comment https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/8rn8ja/i_dont_understand_how_cors_works/
  - only done by the browser, so postman/fetch all that works.
  - Origin refers to the (i think at the website level, a different website) thing that is different from the endpoint. bleh.
  - looks 
- SASS: *Grail* Use SASS it's easy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI
  - Mixin: Just like functions, you could use a *mixin* to set the default properties for flexbox: display, justify-content, align-items @12:00
    - Damn, it's so goooood. You can even pass it variables and set flex-direction dynamically if you want.
- Emmet: *Grail* Want to get better with code completion, this is how it's done!
- ESLint: npm i -D eslint eslint-config-prettier (more for syntax)
- package-lock.json: for production releases. packages can be installed using npm ci and will result in exact version rather than ^***
- YDKJS **GRAIL** Kinda dry but here's a tip. Everything in the world is boring without context. Imagine trying to explain something you love that's just not interesting sounding to someone else. The difference is not that they are not interested. It's that they don't know enought about it. So if you want to teach someone about how great headphones are, tell them to play an instrument, play music, listen to it for years, play concerts, obsess about it, dream about making it better objectively and how better headphones make it easier for you to make better music becomes obvious. So how do you reproduce that you could method act and become the writer with enough information. I'm gonna try that.
